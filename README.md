# DECA Ontario Android App

### [DECA Ontario](http://2016.deca.ca/)
DECA is an international youth business organization, with the Ontario association hosting over 12,000 highschool students at 250+ schools. They host competitions that cater to different areas of business, including finance and marketing amonth others, in order to help students grow as leaders, grow in confidence, and network with the entrepreneurs and business professionals of the future. 
I was personally a DECA member from grade 9 through 12, being chapter President in my last year. Not only did I create a brand new training program for the club, but I also excelled in competition, placing 3rd at the Provincial competition and 2nd at the International competition in Financial Consulting.

### The App
This DECA Ontario Android app was originally intented to be officially published by the organization, but the project lost steam and never reached final fruition on both Android and iOS platforms. It's original purpose was to be a semi-static app that would provide information to DECA Ontario members and links to resources pertaining to their events. 
The following features were implemented:
* A home screen that links to the other subpages of the app
* Information is pulled from a JSON formatted file, and is pulled from a webserver and cached locally
* A social media feed that shows the most recent tweets from the DECA ONtario twitter account
* A list of the DECA Ontario executives, each with their own page
* A list of sortable events, each of which have their own information page and a unique identification bubble
* A calendar page which shows a WebView with a custom Google Calendar view
* A regionals screen, which allows the user to select their regional competition from a dropdown, and saves their preference
* A dynamic provincials dropdown bubble, which not only links to an about screen,, but allows the dynamic loading of various web links.

### Technical Challenges
With every project I take on I always try to expand my working knowledge and implement featrues that I have never worked with before. Here is a breakdown of some of the technical challenges that I faced as I created this app.
* Ease of editing (JSON)
* Background networking and file caching / dynamic reloading

### Timeframe
This app was worked on from late July 2015 to mid November 2015. Progress slowed down significantly because of school and extracurricular committments, especially the fact that I was running my own school's DECA chapter at the same time.
